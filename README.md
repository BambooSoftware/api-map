# api-map
Map API for tloll

This has a few simple routes setup which should be sufficent for our usecase. 
We just need to attach a few maps and we will be good to go.

SETUP
- Download node and npm. I used nvm to do this but you can achive it any number of ways and I wont detail that. 
- Run 'npm install' (npm i for shorthand) to download the dependencies for you
- Run 'node api-map.js' to run the server. 
- You should now be able to hit the different endpoints. Try a few localhost:3000, localhost:3000/map/someMapId
